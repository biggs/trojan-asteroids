# Trojan Asteroids
Trojan asteroids are objects in the stable equilibrium Lagrange points L4 and L5.

Here are a number of simulations from a 2014 computing project on the stability of
such asteroids. See [trojan.pdf] for details.


### Abstract
The three body restricted problem with e = 0 is the case of a ‘planet’ and ‘sun’
orbiting their barycenter in circular orbits, with an object of negligible mass
also orbiting. It can do so in the stable equilibrium Lagrange points L4 and L5,
π/3 from the planet-sun axis. A numerical simulations were carried out which
demonstrated the stability of L4 for a planet sun mass ratio less than 0.04.
Over a range of planet masses there was found to be a linear relationship with
the wander range for a small initial perturbation (as shown in Figure 8).
